# Contribution guidelines

There are a few parts of the project where contributions are highly appreciated. Depending on which one you are planning to contribute, a set of rules must be followed:

## Bug fixes, documentation and enhancement proposals

All of hese categories fall under the same procedure:

1. Create an issue describing your suggestion. Remember to select the correct template and follow its instructions
2. Fork the repository and create a branch where you will implement the changes
3. When finished, create a PR referencing the issue addressed in step one and add the `bug`, `documentation` or `enhancement` label
4. Patiently wait for a moderator to review your changes

## Question database modifications

There are also a few rules and specific tools for question database modifications:

1. Fork the repository and create a branch where you will implement the changes
2. Start a localhost server on the root of the repository (you can use the VSCode task named `[DevTools] PHP: Start local server` and follow the terminal link to view the page)
3. Use the DevTools page to modify as many entries of the database as you want
4. Copy the updated data and replace it on the database file
5. Create a PR describing the changes (whether you have added a question, corrected an answer, updated an explanation...) and add the `database-update` label
6. Patiently wait for a moderator to review your changes
