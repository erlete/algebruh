# Algebruh

Algebruh is an algebra question solver platform. It implements OCR and textual pattern matching technologies to provide with answers to plenty of questions stored in a database.

_**Note**: parts of this documentation are intended for developers alone. All platform usage instructions are located in the web/webapp itself._

## Accessing the platform

There are two ways to benefit from the Algebruh platform tools:

### Webpage access

The easiest way to access the platform is to use [the webpage](https://algebruh.erlete.org). It does not require any specific operating system, architecture or dependencies to work.

### Webapp access

The second wat to access the platform is to use the webapp, whose installer files are available in the [releases](https://github.com/erlete/algebruh/releases) section of the GitHub repository.

You can either download the executable installer or the whole installation directory, in case the first one raises security alerts on your operating system (probably because of the lack of digital signature).

_The application is only available for the Windows x64 OS. Further implementations for different OSs and architectures are not planned, yet under specific circumstances, they could be feasible._

#### Deprecation notice

Versions up to [v1.1.0-legacy](https://github.com/erlete/algebruh/releases/tag/v1.1.0-legacy) (included) are deprecated and kept as legacy code. There will be no active support for said versions. Issues related to them will be automatically discarded and PRs might not be reviewed.
